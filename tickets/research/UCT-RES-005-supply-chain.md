### Research Template
**Title:** Supply Chain Security Research
**Sections:**
- Executive Summary
- Attack Trends & Methodologies
- Third-Party Dependency Analysis
- Vendor Security Evaluation
- Open Source Component Review
- Risk Factors & Attack Vectors
- Recommendations & Best Practices
- References

### Inventory Template
| Dependency Name | Version | Source | Vendor | Risk Level | Notes |
|----------------|---------|--------|--------|-----------|-------|
| ExampleLib     | 2.1.0   | GitHub | ExampleCorp | Medium | Used in payment module |

### Vendor Assessment Checklist
- Is the vendor ISO 27001 certified?
- Does the vendor provide regular security updates?
- Are third-party penetration tests performed?
- Is there a documented incident response process?
- Are software components scanned for vulnerabilities?

### Open Source Analysis Template
| Component | Version | License | Vulnerabilities | Patch Status | Notes |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------------|-------------|-------|
| OpenSSL   | 1.1.1   | Apache  | CVE-2023-1234  | Patched     | Critical for encryption |

### Risk Analysis Template
- List critical supply chain risk factors:
	- Outdated dependencies
	- Unverified vendor security
	- Unpatched open source components
	- Lack of monitoring for supply chain attacks

### Recommendations Template
- Implement SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) for all products
- Require vendors to provide security certifications
- Regularly scan dependencies for vulnerabilities
- Establish incident response for supply chain compromises

### Executive Summary & Report Templates
**Executive Summary:**
Summarize key findings, risks, and recommendations in 1-2 pages for leadership.

**Full Report Structure:**
- Executive Summary
- Methodology
- Findings (Trends, Inventory, Vendor, Open Source, Risks)
- Recommendations
- Appendices (Checklists, Tables)

- [NIST Supply Chain Risk Management](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Supply-Chain-Risk-Management)

### Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) Guidelines
An SBOM is a formal record containing the details and supply chain relationships of components used in software. It should include:

- Component name
- Version
- Supplier
- Dependency relationships
- License information
- Known vulnerabilities

**Sample SBOM Table:**

| Component      | Version | Supplier     | License | Vulnerabilities | Notes                |
|---------------|---------|-------------|---------|----------------|----------------------|
| ExampleLib    | 2.1.0   | ExampleCorp | MIT     | CVE-2023-1234  | Used in payment flow |
| OpenSSL       | 1.1.1   | OpenSSL Team| Apache  | CVE-2023-5678  | Critical for crypto  |

### Supply Chain Attack Case Study Template

**Case Study Title:** [Attack Name]

**Summary:**
Brief description of the attack, affected systems, and timeline.

**Attack Vector:**
How the attacker infiltrated the supply chain (e.g., compromised vendor, malicious update).

**Impact:**
Business, technical, and reputational consequences.

**Lessons Learned:**
Key takeaways and recommendations for prevention.

**Example:**

**Case Study Title:** SolarWinds Supply Chain Attack
